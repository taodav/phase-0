<h3>140216 - Week 1</h3>
<article>
    <section>
       It's been an enlightening journey so far. This first week we've been through what's called version control.
   </section>
   <section>
      <h4> What's version control? </h4>
        Version control is project developer's version of iCloud. Seeing as there's so many developers all working on a single project, there needs to be a system where everyone can back up their work into the cloud, and also retrieve work from the cloud. 
        <br>
        Git is the source code management system that we'll be using. Every time you start work on a part of the project, you create a new copy, or 'branch' of the project to work on. After you finish your work for the day and want to include your finished work into the actual project, you merge your branch with the original, or 'master', branch.

      <section>
      <h4>So what's so great about version control?</h4>
        Version control allows multiple developers to simultaneously contribute to the project instead of all working on shared folders. Without version control, if a new version of the project you're working on suddenly stops working because of bugs, then you'll have no 'backup' to go back to. With version control, since your branch is a copy of the original project, the bug will only affect the separate branch that the developer was working on.

      <section>
      <h4>So how does Git help you track these changes?</h4>
        As mentioned above, when using git, all your work will be done on separate branches that are just copies of the original project just for one developer to work on. After you finish work, you will 'commit' the changes you have made to the project by sending in a commit - the 'bundle' of changes you have just sent in to merge with the project. This commit will have a message attached to it - normally this message will have a detailed description on what changes were made and all the details of the change. This is how git tracks all these changes - if you want to revert to a previous instance of your work, then you can see your list of commits and choose which one to reset to.

      <h4>What is Github and why should I trust it with my code??</h4>
        <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> is an online space for developers to share and code together. Each user has their own profile and their own repositories for their code. It allows you to upload your projects into these repositories so that other people can access this project online. It also allows you to limit who updates your projects by requiring uploaders to make 'pull requests' in order to update the file.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

Throughout this challenge, I've started to use the <section> tag quite a big - it's actually very helpful in grouping different parts together. I've also learnt about the <aside> tag that will be immensly helpful in creating a section beside the text I'm currently working on.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements get laid out from the outermost branch to the innermost branch. The browser also displays these elements in the same fashion - as seen on chrome devtools.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

The biggest take-away from this challenge was learning about the snippets in Sublime. This could be immensly helpful when not only creating an outline for an HTML, but also for other projects that require the repetitive use of HTML lines. The only shortcut I am currently aware of that are already defaults in sublime is the html shortcut.
