How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Chrome's DevTools allow you to change the CSS in your html file without affecting the actual CSS file. It can be used exactly like a CSS editor.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

CSS has a lot of elements used to resize it's elements - the most basic example being the width and height tags. These elements can take on a whole variety of values - for example, you can set a percentage of your parent wrapper as the sizes, or you can set pixel heights.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

absolute - the element is positioned relative to it's 'ancestor' element
fixed - positioned relative to the browser window
static - positioned in order
relative - positioned relative to it's normal position

I feel the easiest to use was the relative positioning - because it allowed you more mobility when positioning elements. The hardest to use was the absolute positioning - it was hard to change any aspect of the position of the element.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margin - space outside of the border
border - physical border to the element
padding - space between element and border

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I think overall this challenge was a bit tedious, and at times a bit confusing. Tedious because some of the challenges were a bit simple, and confusing because it required a lot of googling and trying things out in order to get the correct results.
