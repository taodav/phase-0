- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

As I'm quite familiar with HTML already, creating this website was quite easy and simple.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I think learning through research and then doing it yourself is the best way to learn a coding language like HTML. Once you research something and incorporate it into your code, I feel that's when you really do understand how the function works.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Seeing as this task was quite simple, it was quite easy to keep using the best practices for this challenge. The only part that was a bit more difficult was aligning your 'common practices' with your partner's practices.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML is a very logical way to store your information. I think the best part of HTML is the ability to use div classes to store information - this helps a lot with formatting later on with CSS. The only quips I have about HTML is the fact that there are a lot of not well known tags that some people prefer.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

The best 'trick' or advice I can give is to always remember to close your tags, and remember that HTML is like an onion - there are layers and layers of tags that you incorporate, and when we start including CSS on this tags, you have to really know which tag you want to change.
