# 1.1 Think About Time
Today I was introduced to the benefits of meditation and the specific timebox of pomodoro. I’ve read before that I should be taking 5 minute breaks for every 25 minutes of study, but today’s research was the first time I’ve actually extensively read up on it. Timeboxing is splitting up a period of time for a person or group to work on a task. After the time is up, even if the task is incomplete, the group/person will stop and look back at what they/he/she has accomplished. I think managing my time with timeboxing in phase 0 will be a very useful tool, especially with coding - you are allotted time just to go back and evaluate your work.

Currently, the only way I manage my time is through setting a time for a certain task. For example, “I’ll head to the gym after 30 minutes” or “I’ll start work at 4 o’clock.” I think my current strategy is working quite well, except that I sometimes lose track of time and ‘burst’ the timing I had to meet. When this happens, the chances of me doing what I need to do significantly decrease.

In terms of time management, with all the work I have to plan by myself, I will try to employ the pomodoro timeboxing method, and also take up meditation with the app Getheadspace. I will try to spend 10 minutes after lunch each day in meditation.

A lot of these articles and videos on time management have a general theme - fake it until you make it. This theme is reminiscent of Amy Cuddy’s TED talk on body language that I watched a few years ago. I believe that the physical action of something defines your attitude and behavior a lot more than vice versa. What’s most important about creating a time management plan in Phase 0 is to do what you planned. Everything else will come along with it (including the mentality of productivity), and in the end I think you’ll be able to create good habits for time management.

My overall plan for time management in Phase 0 is to include meditation into my daily schedule and split the day up into timeboxes based on pomodoro.

# 1.2 The Command Line
1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"
A shell is something a person uses in order to use and manipulate an operating system’s environment. Bash is a language in the Unix shell that uses a text window to navigate the system.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

The most challenging thing for me in learning this material was setting my mindset in this new user interface. I’ve been using a GUI the entire time I’ve been using a computer, so changing my mindset to incorporate this whole new system of manipulating my operating system was quite hard for me at first.

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

I was successful in my attempts to understand and use most of the commands, but when we started to get into changing environments, I became very confused. The crash course material started to include things without any description, and the discrepancies between OSX and Windows command lines were quite confusing.

4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

I think the most important commands to know are the pipeline and redirection commands. I think the reason why people still use command line is because you can execute a number of arguments on your files through just one line in the command line.

5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd - Print working directory, or show me what directory I’m currently in.

-ls - list, or show me what files are in the directory I’m currently in.

-mv - move-item, or change this item’s name to something else.

-cd - change-directory, or change the directory I’m currently in.

-../ - previous directory: a reference to the previous directory to the one you’re currently in.

-touch - or New-Item in windows, creates new files.

-mkdir - Make-Directory: creates a new folder.

-less - or More in windows powershell, lists out information page by page.

-rmdir - Remove-Directory: deletes a folder.

-rm - Remove: deletes a file.

-help - Lists and describes the functions of commands
